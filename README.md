Simple Feature Section
Code a simple feature section challenge with HTML and CSS to practice flexbox and nested flexbox.

This was a great opportunity to further sharpen my CSS grid and flexbox skills, and responsive design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.

## Acknowledgements
